False position (also called the linear interpolation method) is another well-known bracketing method. It is very similar to bisection with the exception that it uses a different strategy to come up with its new root estimate. Rather than bisecting the interval, it locates the root by joining f(xl) and f(xu) with a straight line . The intersection of this line with the x axis represents an improved estimate of the root. Thus, the shape of the function influences the new root estimate.
